# Setup
	
You can setup `Search Engine` by simply opening your terminal/console and pasting in the following command:
```
cd <rÃ©pertoire du dossier>
```
After that go in `main_2.py` and complete with your token, id of the roles etc.

After you've done all that, you can finally run Search Engine by typing in the following command:
```
python main_2.py
```
